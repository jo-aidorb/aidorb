aidorb website development

aidorb is a tool to maintain our well-being by empowering the world against climate change.

WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW

1. You only need U$ 3.00 to finance a project (an aidorb) in aidorb.com and reduce climate change.
2. Once a group in the Investments page is fully funded, one of its investors is drawn and profits a considerable amount of money.
3. Each aidorb shows its current progress and CO2e reduction.

Investors will also be notified when the aidorbs they have invested in are fully financed, when their CO2 reduction and project progress are updated, and when the aidorbs are completed!

WHY AIDORB?

1. aidorb summarizes the Global Warming (climate change) potential of each project to a single number of equivalent carbon dioxide emissions.
2. The equivalent carbon dioxide emissions are expressed as CO2. It makes it possible for the public to help without getting lost in escesive information.
3. The aidorb team has people with academic and professional experience. Therefore, aidorb is able to certify the trust of projects around the world and make prime equivalent carbon dioxide emission estimations.

aidorb's founders are and environmental engineer with an Earth Sciences Master by the Universiteit van Amsterdam and a computer scientist with a Database Architectures PhD also by the Universiteit van Amsterdam.
